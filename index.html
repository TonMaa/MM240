        <h3> A litte about me:</h3>
         
        <p>I am  Randy Otanez. I am a full-time student at BMCC and my Major is multimedia programming.  I chose to learn about this skill because I like how computers work and how they can help to become more efficient as the world continues to move towards being more technological every day. Therefore One of my goals is to become a web designer and have an online job that allows me to have freedom in my life.
